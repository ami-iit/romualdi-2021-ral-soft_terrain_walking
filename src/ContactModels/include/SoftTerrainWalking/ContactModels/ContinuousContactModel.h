/**
 * ContinuousContactModel is a model that describe the contact using a continuous representation. It
 * is an extension of the brush model used for describing the contact between the tire and the
 * ground. Each point in the contact surface is subjected to an infinitesimal force \f$ f \f$ given
 * by \f$ f=k(x_0 - x)- b x\f$, where \f$k\f$ is the spring coefficient and \f$b\f$ is the damper
 * coefficient. \f$x\f$ and \f$x_0\f$ are, respectively, the position of the point placed in the
 * contact surface and the point con corresponding to a null contact force written in the inertial
 * frame. Furthermore, during the contact scenario, we assume the link acts as a rigid body. While
 * the environment will deform. The ground characteristics are isotropic, and it can be approximated
 * as a continuum of springs and dampers.
 * The contact surface is supposed to be <b>rectangular</b> and the frame placed on the contact
 * surfaced is centered in the middle of the surface, with the \a z-axis pointing upwards and the \a
 * x-axis pointing forward (parallel to one edge of the rectangle).
